# NineSolsTracker

An item tracker for Nine Sols.
It currently tracks the following:
- Item Drops (e.g. from Chests, or sometimes enemies or destructible environment)
- Jin Chests (Money)
- Encyclopedia Entries
- Shanhai 9000 (Map Chips)
- Miniboss Locations

This tracker shows ALL chest locations, not only those required to complete the normal in-game counter!

NOTE: Location names are placeholders.

## Usage

Install using thunderstore.
In-game, open the map, go into the minimap and out again.
This should reveal the entire map and show all locations.
